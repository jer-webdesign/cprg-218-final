Project: Website Build with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Introduction
You have learned how to use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create web pages that are responsive, accessible, and contain custom functionality and interactive features. You also know how to integrate them with third-party services and assets, rather than relying on the pre-made features in a WYSIWYG system. This is a valuable ability that allows you to create bespoke web designs, ensuring accessibility and consistent design across a website, or even enhance pre-built website templates.

In this project, you will bring together all of the skills you’ve learned in this course to create a custom-coded website.

Instructions
Create a website for a blog, a portfolio, a marketing page for a real or imagined product, or anything else with a cohesive theme or purpose. The purpose of the website should be immediately obvious to visitors, and content should be relevant and follow a cohesive style.

All text content should be written and produced by the student where possible - where not possible proper license terms must be followed. Your website must contain the following components:

At least three pages linked with a responsive navigation menu
Each page should contain at least one embedded image and/or other media (video or audio)
A Google font or other free web font
A favicon
A useful implementation of JavaScript that doesn't directly mirror something done in class or take it further exercises
Your website should follow the principles of accessibility and semantics, be responsive and meet modern web standards. Follow the best practices you have learned and don’t use deprecated code or features. The site must be responsive while following the rules of good design in respect to visual appearance and UI. Your CSS should be in a linked style sheet and should display well at any viewport width between 320 and 3200 pixels.
